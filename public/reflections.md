# Q1 End of Lessons Reflections - YAP, Quinn Mikayela of 9-Li <3

## List and describe at least 5 topics that we discussed in class that you know very well. Each description should be at least 1 paragraph with two to five sentences.
1. *JS Variable Declaration*: variable declaration was relatively easy, dare I say *easier* than C++ variable declaration because of js' automatic typecasting. I can just type var, let, or const depending on what kind of variable I want to put in my code. Coding in variable declaration in my coding accessories is kind of like muscle memory for me at this point because it was very easy to understand and explain.

2. *JS Arithmetic Operators*: arithmetic operators are also just the same as those from C++, so I found it very easy to get used to in js. They weren't too complicated to implement in javascript code either :).

3. *JS Comparison Operators*: the comparison operators were roughly the same, with the exception of the strictly equal (===) and the strictly not equal (!==) operators, but those were easy to understand and get used to as well. This was a very easy topic for me.

4. *JS while loops/do while*: these were also mostly the same as C++ while and do while loops, so I have prior experience already. They were easy to implement in my code and I didn't have any difficulties at all :3

5. *JS for loops*: same as while loops, these were mostly the same as C++ and I still remember the syntax. The only thing different is putting "let x = etc. etc." instead of "int x = etc. etc.". I may not remember how to create the shapes with for loops anymore, but I think I can relearn it pretty easily.

## List at least 5 topics that you know and can describe but needs further practice/discussion and why. The why should be per topic listed.  
1. *JS Functions*: it took me a while to get used to functions being hoisted instead of having to be declared before the code. I also forgot most of the syntax for functions mostly because it wasn't too memorable for me last schoolyear.

2. *JS Logical Operators*: the concept of "truthy" values (aka, strings with values, nonzero numbers) and "falsy" values (aka, "", 0, null, undefined) were very new to me and confused me a little. Especially since there wasn't an in depth discussion about them or even a more elaborate discussion rather than a Kahoot game.

3. *HTML Button Code*: it's kind of hard for me to remember, mostly because the syntax is very long. I personally think this is because I have trouble remembering long syntaxes for code in general, especially some HTML elements.

4. *CS Terms in Terms of JS and HTML*: what I mean is mostly the acronyms like HTTPS, HTML, and stuff like that. I'm not quite sure why, but I don't think I remember the meanings of them even if they were taught to us last year, probably because I mostly focus on practical application when it comes to CompSci.

5. *HTML Tags*: all these tags weren't specifically discussed in class, which led me to sometimes consult w3schools to revisit the different kinds of HTML tags. They were easy to understand, but kind of lacked discussion on the different possible tags to be used.

## Describe on what will be your plan of action in order to help yourself in understanding further the topics listed on the second items.
1. Practice more application by searching for practice exercises online.
2. Read up more on these topics so it's technically muscle memory already when I start coding it.
3. Ask Ma'am Aline for consultation if I'm having a really hard time (sana hindi naman po umabot dun maam hahaha).

## In the activities that were done in class, list at least two that you think were effective and at least two that you think not effective in helping you understand topics in our course and why?
**Effective**

1. *Coding Exercises in Class DIRECTLY after Lessons*: these help us absorb and apply the lesson from the get-go. It also lets us remember the topics much easier.

2. *Speedtests*: these help us work under pressure, but I feel like the coding exercises are slightly better since speedtests kind of makes a few of us stressed because there's a bonus point on the line. I feel like they're good for time pressure based activities though.

**Not Effective**

1. *Kahoot*: the lesson isn't taught in depth after, and since the competitiveness of the kahoot distracts us, I don't think most of us pay attention to the definitions and terms that are defined in between questions. Therefore, most of us didn't quite absorb it.

2. *Debugging Exercises*: debugging exercises are effective when the code isn't too long. Personally, I think the code for the last debugging exercise was a bit too long and complex? But that's from my perspective only.
